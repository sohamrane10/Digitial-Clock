# Digitial-Clock
Developed a Digital Clock GUI using Tkinter in Python, featuring an intuitive interface and accurate time display. Enhanced Python and GUI development skills during this project.

This project involves the creation of a simple yet functional Digital Clock using the Tkinter library in Python. The primary objective was to design a user-friendly graphical interface that displays the current time accurately, updating every second.

# Key Features:
Real-time digital clock with accurate time display.
Minimalistic and intuitive GUI design, ensuring ease of use.
Clock updates dynamically every second without lag.

# Technology Stack:
Python: Used for implementing the logic behind the clock and managing the GUI behavior.
Tkinter: Python's standard GUI toolkit for building the application interface.

# Learnings:
This project enhanced my understanding of Python, specifically in terms of GUI development using Tkinter. I gained hands-on experience in creating dynamic user interfaces and handling real-time data updates.
